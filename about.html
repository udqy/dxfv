        <h2>What are DXF Files?</h2>
        <p>
          DXF is a CAD data file format developed by Autodesk. It was created to enable interoperability between AutoCAD and other software programs. Because of its open nature, it has become a widely used standard for exchanging drawing data between different CAD applications. DXF files can contain both 2D and 3D design information.
